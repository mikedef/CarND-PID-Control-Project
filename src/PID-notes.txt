P Only:
   Kp = 1.0	Oscillate wildly after a few seconds
   Kp = 0.5	Oscillate wildly after 5 seconds
   Kp = 0.1	Oscillate wildly at first turn
   Kp = 0.05	Oscillate wildly after first turn

I Only:
   Ki = 0.5	Turns max angle and gets stuck there
   Ki = 0.05	Turns max angle left and trys max angle right
   Ki = 0.005	Turns max angle left and trys max angle right

D Only:
   Kd = 1.0	Doesn't turn enough
   Kd = 2.0	Better but still doesn't turn enough at the turns
   
PD:
   Kp = 0.05, Kd = 1.0
      Gets around the whole track with minor edge touching
   Kp = 0.05, Kd = 1.5
      Better but still close to the edge during turns
   Kp = 0.05, Kd = 2.5
      Better but still close to the edge during turns
      

PID:
   Kp = 0.05, Ki = 0.005, Kd = 3.0
      Gets around the whole track, but oscillates while driving
   Kp = 0.15, Ki = 0.005, Kd = 3.0
      Gets around the whole track, but oscillates while driving
